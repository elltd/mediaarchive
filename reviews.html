				<p><em>Charm</em>, Clairo’s third studio album, sees her enter a new era in her discography. Characteristically marked by her soft vocals 
                    and mellow pop production, her third entry introduces a 70’s influence that draws upon the sound of artists such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3RTzAwFprBqiskp550eSJX?si=jOLwP73IRhG7tvRo5PHoRg">Harry Nilsson</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3SMY2MGuaUOhuPpgRn6clw?si=Ej8bgxHgQYa-O9EMOlVDBQ">Margo Guryan</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3oDbviiivRWhXwIE8hxkVV?si=rlcUyReDQqCrzenaUaJ0xQ">The Beach Boys</a>. There is an old school essence to every song, with the entire album recorded live on analog tape. I was instantly charmed by the branding design and aesthetics of the record, and I knew this would be a special album to me personally, so I purchased a limited edition merchandise box that dropped on her website which included a CD.

                  </p>  The design of the CD case is subtle yet effective. The album design uses a particular shade of green that is dark, saturated, and has a hint of yellow to it, which matches with the quaint and mellow sound of the music itself. While the front is the album cover, the back lists the song titles off the tracklist. The typography in the design is very playful and whimsical, with some titles having different sized letters, or spaced out like a crossword, or cascading. Interspersed are some small, cute illustrations, one of a lamb, a gnome-like creature, and a baby holding a bunny. For something as simple as a tracklist, I think the back design is very well done, containing elements that thematically fit in with her style of music and general aesthetic.
                    
                   <p> Inside, the case contains a small pamphlet with the Charm album logo on the front. Within the pages lie the artistic credits for every song, along with their lyrics. In the middle, there is a page spread that is a film photograph of Clairo in the recording studio with her team, with everyone looking relaxed. While the design of the pamphlet is simple and clean, I do think that there is room for more design considering the creative direction of all her marketing materials so far. The choice of a plastic clear case of the CD also is questionable. While it is completely serviceable, I think with the artistic, natural style of the album, packaging made of a thick paper would have felt more fitting. The CD itself has a design, which is a photograph of Clairo in the studio again. It is in black and white, and shows her drinking a beer with what looks like an oven glove on while someone we presume to be a producer or mixer sits at a piano with headphones on. Again, you get a relaxed, intimate, and playful feeling from the image. The album and the packaging evokes a sense of nostalgia and whimsy, like you’re lounging on a couch surrounded by friends with the fireplace lit.
				</p>
                   <p> Overall, the music quality of the CD itself was good, with no noticeable faults. In fact, the original recording method made for some light buzzing and effects to her voice that make it feel more vintage, but not in a way that the music itself is worsened by it. In all, the CD feels very on brand, and is a worthwhile addition to my collection.

<p>As someone who is trying to expand their physical media collection, going to Princeton Record Exchange is the perfect place to visit when trying to find something new to buy and add to the shelves. The store is located at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/YN4SRKfH5AtHWWCdA">20 S Tulane St, Princeton, NJ</a>, which is right off Nassau Street and close to many other nicely walkable places I often visit when taking a day trip to the campus. I always find something here, which is why there has never been a time I’ve visited Princeton with my friends that I haven’t stopped by, even briefly. Its location off Nassau Street is convenient, as the store is in close proximity to places like Labyrinth Books (which is just around the corner), Small World Coffee, and the Princeton Garden Theater.

                   </p> 
				   <p>When you walk into the store itself, it doesn’t feel as overwhelming as it can feel in other stores. CDs and records sit right in front of you and the cashier counter sits on the right side of the room, which as you walk further into it, only widens with more shelves and bins of CDs, vinyls, and cassette tapes, along with DVDs, posters, and other merchandise, which you can easily get lost in. A great feature about the store is that its categorized very conveniently, and priced well. There is a whole section of one dollar items, which as you can imagine don’t always contain the most familiar or relevant media, but you can sometimes find a steal there. One of my favorite items I’ve ever purchased was the Top Gun Original Movie Soundtrack in the cassette tape shelf. I’m a big fan of the movie, and I like the songs in the soundtrack, so finding it as a tape for only one dollar was a great purchase.
				</p>
                   <p> The store offers a wide selection of material, no matter what type of fan you are. You can find freshly released items on the shelves, which also don’t shy away from mainstream music. On one side you can find a brand new Taylor Swift album on vinyl, but on the other you can spot a Beatles CD, so there is something for any kind of fan. The store doesn’t pigeonhole itself in what it offers, which makes it a great space for anyone who walks in and might be looking to buy something. For me, the store holds a good variety of media that appeals to my interests, and I’ve never had a problem finding something I recognize.
				</p>
                   <p>Princeton Record Exchange, often referred to as PREX (as seen on their familiar black and white stickers seen on cars, laptops, and water bottles) offers a wide variety of items while also being reasonably priced. Newer releases cost upward of $20 to $40, but you can find new or gently used items for much less if you can sit and browse through the CD shelves long enough. The front counter also offers their own merchandise, but also things like record players for anyone interested. I’d recommend anyone interested in music or physical media to stop by.
